    <h1>A little about me!</h1>
    <p>I am on a self-taught journey, working full time and studying programming in between! Python was my first language and I'm currently pursuing a Full-Stack roadmap.</p>
    

    <strong>3 Full-Stack path resources I considered before starting:</strong>
    <ol>
        <!--Ordered lists here.-->
        <li>appacademy.io</li>
        <li>freecodecamp</li>
        <li>theodinproject</li>
    </ol>

    <strong>Must-haves while studying:</strong>

    <ul>
        <!--Unordered lists here.-->
        <li>Coffee. Obviously.</li>
        <li>A cup of water that's more than half full.</li>
        <li>Arthur Nery's voice playing in Spotify.</li>
        <li>My desk fan.</li> 
    </ul>
