    <h1>A little about me!</h1>
    <p>I am on a self-taught journey, working full time and studying programming in between! Python was my first language and I'm currently pursuing a Full-Stack roadmap.</p>
    
    <p>I started learning on December 2021 and have been documenting my progress on Instagram near the beginning of 2022. </p>
    <p>Prior to starting The Odin Project, I pursued a few courses on edx.org that taught me the foundations and basics of Python, along with data structures & algorithms and object-oriented programming. In the month of April 2022, I took part in the LighthouseLabs 21-Day Data Challenge that taught me some of the basics of matlab, numpy, and SQL. 
    </p>
    <strong>3 Full-Stack path resources I considered before starting:</strong>
    <ol>
        <!--Ordered lists here.-->
        <li>appacademy.io</li>
        <li>freecodecamp</li>
        <li>theodinproject</li>
    </ol>

    <strong>Must-haves while studying:</strong>

    <ul>
        <!--Unordered lists here.-->
        <li>Coffee. Obviously.</li>
        <li>A cup of water that's more than half full.</li>
        <li>Arthur Nery's voice playing in Spotify.</li>
        <li>My desk fan.</li> 
    </ul>
