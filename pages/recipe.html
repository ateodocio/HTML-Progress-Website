            >> Leftover stale bread? No problem. I got your back homie. 
            <br> This incredibly simple <em>(pun intended)</em> recipe will have your mouth watering. 
            <br>All you need is about 5-10 minutes of prep time and you can leave the rest of the job for your oven!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
            <li>1/3 cup of sugar</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>4-6 loaves of bread cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>your choice of topping (fruits, chocolate chips, or assorted nuts)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small saucepan over low heat, warm milk, butter, vanilla, sugar and salt. Continue cooking just until butter melts; cool. Meanwhile, butter a 4-to-6-cup baking dish and fill it with cubed bread.</li>
            <li>Add eggs to cooled milk mixture and whisk; pour mixture over bread. Let bread sit in the mixture for 30 minutes to 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, or until custard is set but still a little wobbly and edges of bread have browned. Serve warm or at room temperature with your topping of choice!.</li>
        </ol>

        If you have a microwave and a cup, then you'll love this one. It takes only a minute or two in cooking time.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup of whole milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Nutella</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk, flour, and baking power in a 12-ounce microwave-safe mug. Whisk until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the Nutella and stir until the batter has little to no clumps. Honestly, I just use a fork to mix.</li>
            <li>Microwave on high for about 45 to 60 seconds. Add 15 more seconds depending on the brownie-like consistency you want.</li>
            <li>For best results, serve with vanila ice cream on top. Yum!</li>
        </ol>
