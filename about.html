				<h1 class="greeting">A little 
					<br>about me !</h1>
				
				<div class="main-paragraph">
					<p>I am on a self-taught journey, working full time and studying programming in between! </p>
						
					<p>Python was my first language and I'm currently pursuing a Full-Stack roadmap.
					I started learning on December 2021 and have been documenting my progress on Instagram near the beginning of 2022. </p>
					<p>Prior to starting The Odin Project, I pursued a few courses on edx.org that taught me the foundations and basics of Python, along with data structures,  algorithms and object-oriented programming.</p>
					<p>In the month of April 2022, I took part in the LighthouseLabs 21-Day Data Challenge that taught me some of the basics of matlab, numpy, and SQL. 
					</p>

					<p><strong><u>3 Full-Stack path resources I considered before starting:</u></strong>
					<ol>
						<!--Ordered lists here.-->
						<li>appacademy.io</li>
						<li>freecodecamp</li>
						<li>theodinproject</li>
					</ol></p>

					<p><strong><u>Must-haves while studying:</u></strong>
					<ul>
						<!--Unordered lists here.-->
						<li>Coffee. Obviously.</li>
						<li>A cup of water that's more than half full.</li>
						<li>Arthur Nery's voice playing in Spotify.</li>
						<li>My desk fan.</li> 
					</ul></p>

					<em>
					<br>Do not try to write perfect code;</em> write code that works, and then decide whether to improve your code for that project or move on to something new. Try to keep this philosophy of simplicity and clarity in mind. "  <em>
