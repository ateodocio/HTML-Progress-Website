            <h3>It's my first website. I am operating on Xubuntu, using VS Code, and following the Odin Project curriculum.</h3>
            <h3>I'm gonna be a <em>full-stack developer with a background in Python.</em>
                <!--headings automatically adds a newline character--> </h3></p>

        <!--Additional line break below just for fun. -->

        <p>
            <!--Is it better to put the text below in individual headers or under one header and with multiple line breaks? Hmm. -->
            <h2>LET'S.</h2></p>
            <h2>GET.</h2>
            <h2>IT.</h2>

            You could spend the <strong>rest of your life learning</strong> all the intricacies of Python and of <strong>programming</strong> in general, but then you would never complete any projects.</p>

        <p>
            <!--em = emphasized text, italicized-->
            <em>Donâ€™t try to write perfect code;</em> write code that works, and then decide whether to improve your code for that project or move on to something new</p>
        
        <p> 
            Try to keep this philosophy of simplicity and clarity in mind.</p>
