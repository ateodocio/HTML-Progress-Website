            It's my first website. I am operating on Xubuntu, using VS Code, and following the Odin Project curriculum.
            <br>
            I am currently pursuing a <em>full-stack developer</em> roadmap with a background in<em> Python.</em>
            I'm using this website to showcase my progress as I go through the course. This will evolve into a responsive, aesthetically-pleasing, and fully built portfolio of my own.</p>

            LET'S GET IT!</p>

            <em>Donâ€™t try to write perfect code;</em> write code that works, and then decide whether to improve your code for that project or move on to something new

            Try to keep this philosophy of simplicity and clarity in mind. "</p>
